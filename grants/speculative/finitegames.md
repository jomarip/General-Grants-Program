# Finite Games

## Project Description
Finite Games is focused on the development of the tools and conceptual demonstrations to support hypercasual e-sport experiences. These experiences will emphasize the extension of the capabilities of blockchain gaming beyond player ownership to the design of mechanisms where in-game decisions have an explicit impact on all other players through a finite world. Essentially, we are creating a persistent global environment where resources are not just finite but consumed during gameplay. Through the use of blockchain digital assets, we can support the development of interoperability. 

To support this foundational concept, we believe that the use of finite digital assets can democratize the esports experience across various aspects of the industry’s verticals. To achieve this democratization, we plan to create NFTs that have a separate permission assigned to the source of its visualization components. This can be used to create an advertisement marketplace where sponsors can directly purchase the ability to rebrand/reskin a player's items based on negotiated conditions. The various functionality will provide a foundation for scaling the esports experience and increasing engagement through the gameplay mechanics. 

The establishment of an independent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace focused on the adtech market has the potential to create a novel use to create lucrative B2B2B (Business to Business to Consumer) opportunities. This could play an important part in establishment the technology stack to support interoperable gaming and individual participation in the advertisement and sponsorship space. We will integrate this project initially as a parachain. However, this will require some development on the substrate framework to provide the components for execution. 

Our team is interested in this project because we wanted to create gaming experiences that have longevity and could make the onboarding of our friends into the cryptocurrency space easier. We are also interested in seeing the economics of our system implemented. We beleive we can create a more accessible means of esports. Also, this infrastructure can be the foundation for even more innovative use cases.

 * Jomari Peterson is the team lead. He is serial entrepreneur with a focus on the design of innovative systems and business models. His past work can be found on Linkedin: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jomari/) and Github (https://gist.github.com/jomarip). Some of his successes include delivering a 10x return as a co-founder of the Quantum Resistant Ledger. He was able to facilitate its growth to $100M valuation. He has also designed novel approaches to proof of stake and microlending solutions. In addition to attending Carnegie Mellon University for his PhD in Engineering & Public Policy, he graduated from Howard University with a focus on a Masters in Business Administration. He also also traveled as an international speaker on Economic Systems, Incentives and Mechanisms. 

 * Whitney Griffith is the developer who initiated the smart contracts that lead to winning at the SF Blockchain Week Gaming Hackathon. Her pastwork can be found on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneygriffith/) and on github (https://gist.github.com/whitneygriffith). Some of her past successes includes being a serial blockchain hackathon winner and Startup Bus winner with Small Street.

## Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, then we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects.  We'll glance at whole repositories too, but not if they contain many vendored dependencies, which often makes commits easier.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Here is a reminder of the main criteria of our grants:
* Focus on Substrate / Polkadot related projects.
* Max $100k.
* Timeframe: up to 3 months is ideal.
* Open source license (the preferred license is Apache 2.0)

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product.

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone).
* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* We will create a... (Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added).
* We will deliver... (Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended).
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

## Future Plans
* Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.
